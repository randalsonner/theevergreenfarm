				<h2>About The Evergreen Farm</h2>

				<p>The Evergreen Farm has been owned and operated by Jeff and Bev Thorne for a dozen years, with help and support from our children: Brian, Betsy and Mike. Now that Brian is in medical school in Wisconsin, and Betsy works in Nashville following her graduation from Vanderbilt University, Mike continues to help in a big way! He is a student at nearby Lafayette College, so he leads the team of youth who help our customers choose their perfect Christmas tree. We're ready for you, looking forward to seeing your family this year.</p>

				<p>Come tag your tree early! Tagging reserves your chosen tree. Return when you're ready to take the tree home. We'll help by cutting it, carrying it down the hill, trimming branches off as you like, baling it, drilling a hole in its base if you'd like, and even tying it onto your car! While we work, you can enjoy hot cider &mdash; made from our own apples &mdash; and freshly baked cookies right out of the oven while you stay warm by the fire.</p>
				
				<p>We've got lots more! We also offer pre-cut trees in addition to the choose &amp; cut trees. We carry wreaths, roping, tree stands, ornaments, lights, and live balled trees. We've got a small gift shop. We'll make custom wreaths for you, and grave blankets for your loved ones. Give us a call &mdash; we'll prepare just what you want!</p>

									<h4>Canaan Fir</h4>
									<p>These trees are very popular, and we have a lot of them. They have relatively long needles and are much softer to the touch than Blue Spruce. These trees are often mistaken for Fraser Fir trees. They have a bottlebrush-like appearance. They often have a blue or silver tinge to them on the underside of the branches.</p>

								<p>These trees are elegant and beautiful. Their branches are strong and sharp. They have a nice blue tinge to them and they are great for displaying ornaments because they are so strong. But, they are sharp to the touch and may not be appropriate for a house with young children.</p>

					<p>Most of our trees are 6-10 foot in height. They are priced by the foot, and the price is $10 per foot. The price includes all of the extras as well:  cutting the tree, baling it, drilling a hole in the bottom, and tying it on your car. We do also have a good number of taller trees. Please come early if you want a tall tree, or call to find out what we have available.</p>

					<h2>Caring for Your Tree</h2>

					<div id="firsttip" class="tip">
						<div class="circle" title="Proper Tree Care"></div>
						<h4>What is the proper care?</h4>
						<p>There are several key steps to ensure that your tree stays fresh and attractive. After purchasing the tree of your choice, we will bale it in loose netting. This open-weave sleeve will make it easier for you to get your tree home, and to protect it on the way. We also have twine, and our assistants will help you secure the tree onto or into your car.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>
					</div>

					<div id="secondtip" class="tip">
						<div class="circle" title="Carrying Tree"></div>
						<h4>What should you do when you bring your tree home?</h4>
						<p>When you get home, you should immediately put the tree base into fresh water. If you don't do this within 4 hours, then cut an additional inch off the stump of your tree before placing the tree in fresh water. A fresh cut will help the tree absorb water and stay fresh, and is necessary if a tree's sap has sealed over the cut. You can put the tree inside immediately for decorating, or you can leave the tree in any cool, shady place sheltered from winds or heat. Either way, we recommend keeping the netting on your tree until it is in your stand in your home.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>
					</div>

					<div id="thirdtip" class="tip">
						<div class="circle" title="Keep Tree Green"></div>
						<h4>How should you keep your tree green?</h4>
						<p>Fresh trees tend to be very thirsty, so be sure to water it daily. A tree in a warm room can absorb as much as four pints of water a day, which is lost by evapotranspiration through the needles. You should check your tree daily, and add water as needed to make sure that the base of the tree is always covered with water. Check your tree closely, because with some stands, there can be water in the stand even though the base of the tree is no longer submerged in water.</p>
